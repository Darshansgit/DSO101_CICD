<u><b><i>Dear Software Engineering Students,</i></b></u>

Welcome to the DSO101 Class Notes Repository!

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the class notes, exercises, and instructions for the DSO101 course. Whether you're a student looking to review previous lessons you'll find everything you need right here.

All the class notes are organized by topic, making it easy for you to navigate through the material. The course is divided into several units, each covering a different aspect of computer science and programming.

You will be tasked to **complete all of the exercises provided** (which includes in-class practicals and assingments) in the class notes to reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered in the course and **push to your github repo**

Feel free to explore the various folders and files within this repository to access the class notes for each topic covered in the course. Each set of notes is accompanied by exercises and clear instructions to help you reinforce your understanding of the material.
